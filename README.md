3. Data Collection Methodology:
   - The data, which is of Monthly Natural Gas consumptions over 39 disctricts in Instanbul, was given straight from Instanbul's Municipality Website. The way the data was collected is not specified. Despite this, the municipality gathered this information on a monthly basis from 2015 to 2023.

4. Why does the dataset intrigue me?
   - The dataset intrigues me because firstly, Instanbul is a place I want to visit. But more importantly, this data set allows us to use time series and forecasting to predict long term trends for gas consumption. That would allow us to make inferences about urban development and economic impacts.
